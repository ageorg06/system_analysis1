# User Story: The Complete Sales Process at Viv's Vintage Wear

## Primary Scenario: Sarah's Shopping Experience

Sarah, a fashion-conscious customer, visits Viv's Vintage Wear on a busy Saturday afternoon. She has selected several vintage items: a 1970s denim jacket, a vintage silk scarf, and a pair of retro sunglasses. She also has some clothes she'd like to donate through the Gift Your Old Gear scheme.

### The Initial Interaction
When Sarah approaches the counter, Jenny, the Sales Assistant, warmly greets her. Jenny begins scanning each item, with the system automatically updating the inventory count for each scanned piece. The total comes to £85.

### Gift Your Old Gear Process
Jenny notices Sarah's donation bag and asks if she'd like to participate in the Gift Your Old Gear scheme. Sarah presents three gently used clothing items. Jenny carefully inspects each piece, confirming they meet the donation criteria - they're clean, in good condition, and suitable for resale. After recording the donation in the system, it automatically applies a 15% discount to Sarah's purchase, reducing her total to £72.25.

### Discount Card and Mailing List
Sarah remembers she received a £10 gift card in the latest seasonal brochure. She presents it to Jenny, who validates it through the system. The card is valid, and the system applies the additional discount, further reducing Sarah's total to £62.25. The system retains the used card information for auditing purposes.

Seeing that Sarah is a engaged customer, Jenny asks if she'd like to join their mailing list. Interested in staying updated about vintage finds and future promotions, Sarah agrees. She provides her email address and postal address, indicating she'd like to receive both email updates and physical brochures. Jenny records these preferences in the system.

### Payment Process
When it comes time to pay, Sarah decides to use her gift card, which she received for her birthday. Jenny processes the gift card, but the system shows it only has £50 remaining. Jenny informs Sarah that she'll need to provide an additional payment method for the remaining £12.25. Sarah opts to pay the difference with her credit card.

Jenny processes the card payment through the system, which connects to the payment gateway. The transaction is approved, and the system records both payments - the £50 gift card and the £12.25 credit card payment.

### Completion
The system generates a detailed receipt showing:
- The original total (£85)
- The Gift Your Old Gear discount (15% off)
- The £10 promotional card discount
- The split payment between gift card and credit card
- The donation record for Gift Your Old Gear

Jenny prints the receipt and hands it to Sarah along with her purchased items, thanking her for her donation and for joining the mailing list. Sarah leaves the store satisfied with her vintage finds, knowing her donated clothes will benefit others, and looking forward to receiving updates about future promotions.

## Alternative Scenarios

### What Could Have Gone Differently?

1. **Donation Rejection**
   If Sarah's clothes hadn't met the donation criteria (e.g., damaged or unclean items), Jenny would have had to explain why they couldn't be accepted, and no discount would have been applied.

2. **Invalid Discount Card**
   If Sarah's £10 discount card had been expired or already used, Jenny would have explained this, and that portion of the discount wouldn't have been applied.

3. **Payment Issues**
   If Sarah's credit card had been declined, Jenny would have requested an alternative payment method for the remaining balance.

4. **System Issues**
   In case of system problems, Jenny could have processed the transaction manually using the backup paper-based system, ensuring the store could still serve customers effectively.
